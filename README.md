# Treasure Hunt

In the end I like to implement a game of treasure hunting that can be played with multiple players (like a MUD).
I plan to implement a core that represents the game world and that runs independently from the players.

Multiple clients (Rich Client implemented in JavaFX 8 and web clients implemented in Play) shall be able to connect and play.
I like to use this project to update my programming skills.

Planned technologies:

* Core: Scala/Akka
* Rich Client: ScalaFX / ScalaFXML
* Web Client: HTML5 with Play
